# üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup for Data Science Training

Set up these tools and platforms before diving into the projects and topics:

---

## 1. üíª Install Python and Anaconda
- Download Anaconda (includes Python + Jupyter) from: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- During installation, allow the installer to set environment variables.
- Launch **Jupyter Notebook** to verify the setup.

---

## 2. üßÆ Get Familiar with Jupyter Notebook
- Open Anaconda Navigator or use terminal/command prompt:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Create a new notebook and try simple Python expressions to test.

## 3. üì¶ Install Key Python Libraries (if not already installed via Anaconda)
Open a terminal or Anaconda Prompt and run:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn



## 4. üß¨ Sample Dataset Access
- Use .csv datasets for practice. Some recommended sources:
- Kaggle Datasets
- UCI Machine Learning Repository

## 5. üß∞ Optional: Set Up Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
For those who prefer a code editor:
- Download VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com
- Install Python extension.
- Run .ipynb files directly in the editor.

## 6. ‚úÖ Confirm Your Environment is Ready
Run this in a Jupyter Notebook:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

print("Libraries installed successfully!")



## üîê Optional: Version Control with Git (For Capstone)
- Install Git: https://git-scm.com/
- Sign up on GitHub
- Learn basic Git commands to track your capstone progress.
